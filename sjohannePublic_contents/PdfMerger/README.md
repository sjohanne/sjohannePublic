# ATT! ATT! ATT! you need to download the entire folder and then create a shortcut from the .jar file you can put the shortcut on the desktop and just click it and it will run the GUI window. you create a shortcut by right click the item in question and selecting create a shortcut or something similar(don't really know what windows says since I use linux xD)

# PdfMerger is a simple Graphical program to merge pdf files.It can merge multiple pdf files and it can also split a single pdf file into a smaller pdf. the syntax for the page numbers in is "1,2,3" or "1-5" or "1,3,6,8-11,23" etc so can read both a range and single pages and can mix those =), this version is in swedish, but can re:edit and throw up an english version in a soon future too =).


# Feel free to use it to your hearts content, but your not allowed to distribute for money.
# I will gladly take ideas and suggestions but, refrain from Angry voices regarding missing features or etc since it is a free product after all.
# It will ask you which files you wanna use and you can move these around up and down, and then it will ask you where to store the pdf file it will create which will contain the pdf files in order from top to bottom in the left square and the pages NOT IN NUMERICAL ORDER BUT IN THE ORDER _YOU_ SPECIFY IN THE DIALOGUE.

# ATT! ATT! If you leave the page number one blank it will set it to 1-100.000 so most likely it will use all the pages in that pdf file. If you specify pages outside of the range of existing pages in that pdf it will simply ignore those only the pages outside of the range the rest will be included.
